When to Use Each Command

    ./vendor/bin/sail up: Use this when you want to start the containers and see real-time logs for debugging purposes.
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d: Use this for starting the containers in the background, typically for regular development work where you don't need to see the logs continuously.
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d --build: Use this when you have made changes to the Dockerfile or other configuration files and need to rebuild the Docker images.
